# Experimental Data for JGR: Oceans Submission
This repository contains the experimental data used in the paper:
"Experimental Study of Submarine Landslide Tsunami in Stratified Sand and Silt Layers on a Gentle Slope"

## Repository Structure
- `Case_A1_time_series.txt` : Time-series data for Case A1
- `Case_A1_summary.txt` to `Case_C1_summary.txt` : Maximum and minimum water levels for each trial in Cases A1–C1
- A1.mp4: video used for overall results
- A1_cam1_3-5.mp4: video used to confirm formation of water film

## Data Format
### Time-series file (Case_A1_time_series.txt)
Format:
- time (s)
- WG1, WG2, WG3, ... : wave gauges (mm)
- PP1, PP2, ... : pore pressure transducers (kPa)

### Maximum values files (case_A2.txt, etc.)
Format:
- 1, 2, 3,...: wave gauge number
- mim: minimum amplitude at each wave gauge (mm)
- max: maximum amplitude at each wave gauge (mm)
